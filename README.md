This library, developed during the course of (**IN480** - _Parallel and Distributed Computing_ - 2018/19) has the purpose to project and encode the base elements of **_Non Uniform Rational B_Spline_** theory.

In a proper manner, this should be the starting point toward a future collaboration with a larger project wich is **LAR** - [_Linear Algebraic Representation_](https://github.com/cvdlab/LinearAlgebraicRepresentation.jl).
